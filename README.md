# foody-app-reactJs
This is a tutorial based project where Iam applyingconcepts like : react hooks, use effect, use context and also use reducer.
 Food Order app.
It's a simple dummy food order app where a list of meals from which we can choose. And we can then add these meals to the cart, also changed their amounts and also add them multiple times.
And of course we can also view the carts to see what's in the cart here. We can also change our cart from that page if we want to.
